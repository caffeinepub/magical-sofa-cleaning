Additionally, the diff shows a “Service Areas” item added to the generic services list, which was not requested (the request was for a dedicated section).",

      "requirement": "Implement a new “Service Areas” section on the landing page matching the provided snippet structure/styling (section py-16 bg-white > container > centered h2 > responsive 2-column grid with two area cards; inner locality grid uses sm:grid-cols-3).",
      "reason": "The only provided LandingPage.tsx diff content is truncated before any dedicated Service Areas section markup appears, so the required section structure and Tailwind classes cannot be confirmed from the diff evidence.",
