  "summary": "LandingPage.tsx was refactored toward the requested simplified layout (sticky navbar with tel: link, English headings, logo fallback, and IntersectionObserver-based UPI visibility state). However, due to truncation and limited evidence, several snippet-exact requirements (UPI QR URL, full rate list details for both cards, and 2026 footer text) cannot be confirmed. Additionally, unrelated changes appear to have been made (SEO metadata, Tailwind theme token expansion), and the footer may include unrequested attribution.",
