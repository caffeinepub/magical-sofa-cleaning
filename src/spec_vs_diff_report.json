  "summary": "LandingPage.tsx shows a new sticky navbar, hero section, and at least the first two service-rate cards with hover lift and icon replacements via lucide-react/react-icons and inline SVG. However, the diff for LandingPage.tsx is truncated before the full services grid and subsequent sections, so several REQ-1 elements cannot be verified from the provided evidence. Additional edits to project_state.json and frontend-file-summaries.txt appear unrelated to the requested UI update.",
